# Enablement Topics

To help you get started building, we've come up with a set of topics that we think might be useful, and have put together content so you can
level up before you get started. 

## SAP Cloud Platform Workflow

Session Owner: [DJ Adams](https://github.com/qmacro)

With the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service you can build process definitions that combine system access, business logic and user tasks (for people to be given the chance to make decisions) in an easy and intuitive way. Add to this the fact that you can use the integration capabilities to make HTTP calls to external services, and also interact with running instances of these definitions via a rich set of APIs, and the workflow service just might be the backbone of the whatever you'll end up building.

Level up using the content linked from the [SAP Cloud Platform Workflow enablement topic page](./workflow.md).

## ABAP RESTful Application Programming(RAP) Model

Session Owner: [Rich Heilman](https://github.com/rich-heilman)

In this overview of the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model, learn how to use proven and new technologies, such as Core Data Services (CDS) and Behavior definition and implementation languages, to build SAP Fiori apps and Odata services with SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment and on premise SAP S/4HANA.
