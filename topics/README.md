# Enablement Topics

To help you get started building, we've come up with a set of topics that we think might be useful, and have put together content so you can
level up before you get started. 

## SAP Cloud Platform Workflow

Session Owner: [DJ Adams](https://github.com/qmacro)

With the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service you can build process definitions that combine system access, business logic and user tasks (for people to be given the chance to make decisions) in an easy and intuitive way. Add to this the fact that you can use the integration capabilities to make HTTP calls to external services, and also interact with running instances of these definitions via a rich set of APIs, and the workflow service just might be the backbone of the whatever you'll end up building.

Level up using the content linked from the [SAP Cloud Platform Workflow enablement topic page](./workflow/readme.md).

## ABAP HTTP Connectivity & ABAP RESTful Application Programming(RAP) Model

SAP has launched the SAP Kyma Runtime, officially “SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory, Kyma runtime”. With this, you can now get a Kubernetes-based runtime offering as part of SAP Cloud Platform next to the Cloud Foundry application runtime, or ABAP runtime – letting you choose what best fits your needs.
