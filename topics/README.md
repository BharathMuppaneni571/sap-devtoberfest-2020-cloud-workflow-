# Enablement Topics

To help you get started building, we've come up with a set of topics that we think might be useful, and have put together content so you can
level up before you get started. 

## SAP Cloud Platform Workflow

With the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service you can build process definitions that combine system access, business logic 
and user tasks (for people to be given the chance to make decisions) in an easy and intuitive way. Add to this the fact that you
can use the integration capabilities to make HTTP calls to external services, and also interact with running instances of 
these definitions via a rich set of APIs, and the workflow service just might be the backbone of the whatever you'll end  
up building.

Level up using the content linked from the [SAP Cloud Platform Workflow enablement topic page](./workflow.md).
