# Enablement Topics

To help you get started building, we've come up with a set of topics that we think might be useful, and have put together content so you can
level up before you get started. 

## SAP Cloud Platform Workflow

Session Owner: [DJ Adams](https://github.com/qmacro)

With the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service you can build process definitions that combine system access, business logic and user tasks (for people to be given the chance to make decisions) in an easy and intuitive way. Add to this the fact that you can use the integration capabilities to make HTTP calls to external services, and also interact with running instances of these definitions via a rich set of APIs, and the workflow service just might be the backbone of the whatever you'll end up building.

Level up using the content linked from the [SAP Cloud Platform Workflow enablement topic page](./workflow/readme.md).

## ABAP HTTP Connectivity & ABAP RESTful Application Programming(RAP) Model

## SAP Kyma Runtime

What is Kyma??? - Kyma /kee-ma/ is a platform for extending applications with serverless functions and microservices. It provides a selection of cloud-native projects glued together to simplify the creation and management of extensions.  

SAP has launched the SAP Kyma Runtime, officially “SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory, Kyma runtime”. With this, you can now get a Kubernetes-based runtime offering as part of SAP Cloud Platform next to the Cloud Foundry application runtime, or ABAP runtime – letting you choose what best fits your needs.

Learn what Kyma is and how you can adopt it as a company to better extend your existing On-Prem and Cloud solutions.

**SAP HANA’s Spatial Engine** allows you to process and analyze spatial data like a geo-ninja. Learn how to handle geo-spatial data and derive advanced insights on an SQL level. Since SAP HANA is following the OGC standards, you will be easily able to visualize your work on almost any map.

Networks are all around us - road networks, social networks, supplier networks, communication networks etc. The **SAP HANA Graph engine** allows you to model, process, and analyze connected data. Learn how to work with graphs within the SAP HANA database.

## Google Chrome Extensions

"Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They enable users to tailor Chrome functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences. They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

An extension must fulfill a single purpose that is narrowly defined and easy to understand. A single extension can include multiple components and a range of functionality, as long as everything contributes towards a common purpose.", so the [short description of Google Chrome Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions). 

Do you use some chrome extensions yourself and have often thought about writing a chrome extension yourself, but you don't know what's necessary and what the first steps are? We interviewed Jeffrey Groneberg, Principal Cloud Solution Architect, about his first Chrome Extension.
