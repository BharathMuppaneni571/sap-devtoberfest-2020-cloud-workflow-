## Learning by doing

What is Kyma??? - Kyma /kee-ma/ is a platform for extending applications with serverless functions and microservices. It provides a selection of cloud-native projects glued together to simplify the creation and management of extensions.  

This series of instructional videos will introduce you to the Kyma Open Source Runtime. During the course of these exercises you will learn not only what Kyma is but also how to setup Kyma locally on your machine as well as on an Hyper-Scaler. You will experience how you can successfully deploy to the Kyma environment and extend it through different services.

In an additional exercise you will get walked through how you can connect an SAP Cloud Platform Fiori for iOS SDK app to your Kyma deployed APIs and consume data through SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services.

Get ready and excited for some Kyma-ing!
