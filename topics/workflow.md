# SAP Cloud Platform Workflow

Here you'll find content to help you level up with the [SAP Cloud Platform Workflow](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/WORKFLOW_SERVICE/Cloud/en-US) service.

## Learning by doing

We have a set of exercises that help you get to know the workflow service. They take you through a series of tasks, covering everything from setting the service and tools up in an SAP Cloud Platform trial account, through installing and configuring an SAP Cloud Connector, just in case you want to make service calls to on-prem systems, to creating your own workflow definitions, invoking them directly and also through the Workflow APIs. 

You can follow these exercises yourself, at your own pace, using the resources in the [Virtual Event Pilot - SAP Cloud Platform Workflow](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-platform-workflow-virtual-event/) repository. You can also watch video equivalents of each of the exercises, recorded by the Developer Advocates team, where we run through each of the exercises one by one.
