# Exercise 03 - Deploy the Fiori app to SAP Cloud Platform

In this exercise, you'll deploy the web app to the HTML5 Application Repository and embed it in a Fiori Launchpad. In the environment, the Fiori app will be able to leverage the  UI5 flexibility services fully.

## Inspiration for the build week

The UI5 tooling provides three types of extension points: [custom tasks](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomTasks/), [custom server middleware](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware/) and [project shims](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/ProjectShims/). New extensions can be used to simplify the development process of SAPUI5 apps and to make developers more productive.  In this exercise, for example, you used the [ui5-task-zipper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui5-task-zipper) which is an open source plugin for the [UI5 tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/). 

In case you are looking for projects to work on during the [build week](../README.md#build-week), a UI5 tooling extension might be a good place to start.

## Summary
You've learned how to bundle the Fiori app to link it to the launchpad service. For deployment, you cloned a sample project and replaced another web app with this bundled app. In the end, you were able to make personalization changes to the Fiori application.
