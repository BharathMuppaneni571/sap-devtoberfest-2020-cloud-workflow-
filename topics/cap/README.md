# SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

Here you'll find content to help you level up with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap).

## Learning by doing

In a series of videos the SAP Developer Advocates will not only introduce you to the Big Picture and the concepts of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), they'll also explain the steps to build your first standalone application. You will start with a very rudimentary data model and simple OData services, and then make enhancements with some server-side JavaScript (Node.js) to implement your own business logic. Finally, you'll use different database systems such as SQLite and SAP HANA Cloud for storing your data and use SAP Cloud Platform as the target runtime environment for your first CAP application. 

The videos are based on a series of exercises. You can follow these exercises yourself, at your own pace, as well as watch the videos below, where we run through each step of each exercise.
