# SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

**This enablement content is for Devtoberfest Week 3 : 7 September → 11 September 2020.**

Here you'll find content to help you level up with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap).

## Learning by doing

In a series of videos the SAP Developer Advocates will not only introduce you to the Big Picture and the concepts of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), they'll also explain the steps to build your first standalone application. You will start with a very rudimentary data model and simple OData services, and then make enhancements with some server-side JavaScript (Node.js) to implement your own business logic. Finally, you'll use different database systems such as SQLite and SAP HANA Cloud for storing your data and use SAP Cloud Platform as the target runtime environment for your first CAP application. 

If you have any questions when doing the exercises for this topic, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-devtoberfest-2020/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question%2C+topic-cap&template=exercise-question.md&title=Summarize+your+question+here) on this repository - please make sure you [use this issue template](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-devtoberfest-2020/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question%2C+topic-cap&template=exercise-question.md&title=Summarize+your+question+here) with the labels 'topic-cap' and 'question'. Thanks!

The videos are based on a series of exercises. You can follow these exercises yourself by watching the videos below, where we run through each step of each exercise. 

### Videos

We've also recorded these exercises individually, for you to watch. We'll be airing them all for the first time on YouTube as [premieres](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9080341). Premieres are videos that appear initially on YouTube at a specific date and time, and the video author is usually there in the chat and available to answer questions on the content. 

For you, this means that you can set a reminder for the premieres to get notifications of when they're going live, and then join on YouTube to watch the content together, along with your fellow developers and friends, and also with the SAP Developer Advocate responsible. This means that you can chat live with them and ask questions during the event.

Don't worry if you can't make a premiere, though! After the premiere is over, the video will be available for anyone to watch at any time after that, just like a normal YouTube video (and it will keep the same URL). 

Here's what the premiere schedule looks like:
