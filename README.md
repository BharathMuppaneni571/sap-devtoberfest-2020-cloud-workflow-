## Description

SAP TechEd Devtoberfest – An open celebration of what makes us developers – Coding and Collaboration! 
This is a 6 week celebration by developers, for developers to kick off the SAP TechEd 2020 season
It will launch with 5 weeks of technical enablement online sessions open to the entire community to highlight key technologies and techniques and plant seed ideas
Topics will include: Kyma, CAP, Fiori, ABAP, SCP APIs, Workflow, Data Intelligence, Building VSCode Extensions, Running Community Open Source Projects 
Then culminate in a one week, build event (avoiding the hackathon term) 
The Challenge:
Come up with your own developer problem – for the pure love of building something. Build something that makes your fellow SAP developers lives better in open source. All projects during the build week will be given back to the SAP developer community. It could be a tool, a library, or even just a code sample. 
The real “prize” here is for the whole developer community which will benefit from what is built or started during this event
Github is the open platform for this entire event! Code, collaboration, planning, submission, support from SAP, etc - - all via Github
Even our planning and communication will be done primarily via Github: https://github.com/sap-samples/sap-devtoberfest-2020
Participants – 100 main participants divided into 10 teams grouped by time zone and topic interest to facilitate communication 
But the whole SAP developer community will be encouraged to participate as well.  Like any open source project teams are encouraged to do as much as possible in the open and even accept issues and pull requests from non-team members during the build week
Throughout the week of the main build event we will also do live streams to interview and expose the community to the teams competing //  Make it a spectator sport! Pundit, updates – sports metaphor 
The output of the week will be code published to Github and a 6 minute video demo of the solution (video due date can be slightly later than the end of the event but still well before the main TechEd for the community to review in advance)
During TechEd, voting will be open for the community to select the winner
Replay and promote content from the Devtoberfest build week but mostly focus on the voting and then presentation of the winning team and their solution towards the end of TechEd in Channel One
Judging
**How relevant/helpful is your solution to other SAP developers**
No commercial license
Not focused on just the “polish” of the final demo
How well does it utilize the key SAP technologies
How much of its was actually built during the event and how much was reuse
